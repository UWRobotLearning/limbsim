Limbsim is under **heavy development** but will ensure code on master is stable, linted, and tested.

## dev

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:UWRobotLearning/limbsim.git

# install deps
pip install -e .[dev]

# install pre-commit hooks for linting before commits
pre-commit install

# run lint & tests locally
nox

```
